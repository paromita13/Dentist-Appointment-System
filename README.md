# Dentist-Appointment-System
This repository contains my first C programming project: a Dentist Appointment Management System. 
-Add new appointments
-View all appointments
-Search by patient name
-Edit or delete appointments
-Sort appointments by date
-Automatically save & load from a file
-The system uses a simple login, structures, arrays, string handling, and file I/O.

This is a fully console-based project designed for beginners but implemented with clean structure and real-clinic logic.
